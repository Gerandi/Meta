# OpenAlex Migration Guide

## âœ… MIGRATION COMPLETE - APRIL 2025

This document outlines the changes made to migrate from multiple search providers to OpenAlex for paper searching in the Meta project.

## Overview

We've replaced the previous search implementation that used multiple APIs (Crossref, Semantic Scholar, Scopus, Exa.ai) with a single, robust OpenAlex integration. OpenAlex is an index of hundreds of millions of interconnected scholarly papers with a free and open API.

## Completed Changes

### Backend Changes
1. Removed all other provider implementations (Crossref, Semantic Scholar, etc.)
2. Updated configuration to use proper email settings for OpenAlex
3. Simplified `paper_search_service.py` to only use OpenAlex
4. Updated DOI service to use OpenAlex for paper lookup
5. Enhanced `openalex_search.py` to properly handle all search functionality
6. Maintained API response format for backward compatibility

### Frontend Changes
1. Updated the database selector to use only OpenAlex (disabled selection)
2. Modified loading message to reflect the single database
3. Fixed provider parameter handling
4. Ensured announcement banner about the new search engine is visible

## Benefits

- **Simpler Code**: Single API instead of multiple providers
- **Better Reliability**: Fewer error sources, no more [object Object] errors 
- **More Consistent Results**: All results come from a single, well-structured source
- **Improved Relevance**: OpenAlex has strong native relevance ranking
- **Better Performance**: The polite pool in OpenAlex offers faster and more consistent response times

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
1. Various search queries with different complexity
2. Different filters (year range, open access, author, journal)
3. Pagination with large result sets
4. Sorting by relevance, date, and citations

## What's Next

Consider implementing these further improvements:
1. Add caching for frequent searches to reduce API load
2. Enhance the abstract formatting for better readability
3. Add citation network visualization using OpenAlex relationships
4. Implement automated tests specifically for OpenAlex integration
