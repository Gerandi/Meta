# Meta Project - Implementation Notes

## Recent Changes

### OpenAlex Migration (April 2025)

We've successfully completed the migration from multiple search providers to relying solely on the OpenAlex API. Key changes include:

1. **Simplified Backend**: Removed multiple provider implementations and standardized on OpenAlex for all paper searches
2. **Better API Configuration**: Added proper email configuration for the OpenAlex polite pool
3. **Improved Frontend**: Removed provider selection UI elements as they're no longer needed
4. **Consistent Results**: All search results now come from the same high-quality source

## Issues Fixed

1. **[object Object] error when selecting a specific database**: Fixed by implementing a centralized error handling function for all API providers, which properly handles errors and returns an empty array instead of propagating the error object.

2. **Irrelevant search results**: Implemented a proper relevance scoring system that evaluates how well papers match the search query by checking the title, abstract, journal, and keywords. Results are sorted by relevance score.

3. **Pagination issues**: Modified the frontend to cache search results and handle pagination locally instead of making new API requests for each page change.

## Backend Changes

### OpenAlex Search (openalex_search.py)

1. Enhanced implementation to properly use configuration settings for email
2. Improved error handling for API requests
3. Enhanced result formatting for consistent output

### Paper Search Service (paper_search_service.py)

1. Completely refactored to rely solely on OpenAlex
2. Removed all other provider implementations
3. Maintained API compatibility by keeping parameters structure

## Frontend Changes

### Paper Search Component (PaperSearch.vue)

1. Modified to use the advanced search endpoint for all searches.
2. Added caching for search results:
   - Stores complete result set in memory
   - Handles pagination locally without new API calls
   - Only makes a new API call when changing search parameters
  
3. Updated pagination methods to use the cached results.
4. Modified filter clearing to reset cached results and restart search with clean parameters.

## How to Test

1. Search for papers using any keywords.
2. Check that results are relevant to your search query.
3. Test pagination by navigating between pages and verify that:
   - It's faster than before (no loading spinner between pages)
   - The results are consistent (same papers shown in the same order)
   - No unexpected errors appear in the console

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive relevance scoring by including natural language understanding.
2. Implement partial word matching for better search results.
3. Add highlighting of matched terms in the search results.
4. Consider implementing server-side caching to reduce API calls for common searches.
