# Meta Project - Implementation Notes

## Issues Fixed

1. **[object Object] error when selecting a specific database**: Fixed by implementing a centralized error handling function for all API providers, which properly handles errors and returns an empty array instead of propagating the error object.

2. **Irrelevant search results**: Implemented a proper relevance scoring system that evaluates how well papers match the search query by checking the title, abstract, journal, and keywords. Results are sorted by relevance score.

3. **Pagination issues**: Modified the frontend to cache search results and handle pagination locally instead of making new API requests for each page change.

## Backend Changes

### API Client (api_client.py)

1. Added `calculate_relevance_score` function to determine how relevant a paper is to the search query.
2. Implemented `get_provider_data` to centralize error handling for all provider API calls.
3. Maintained backward compatibility with existing API functions.

### Additional Providers (additional_providers.py)

1. Rewrote `search_papers_combined` to:
   - Use the centralized error handling
   - Filter results by relevance score
   - Handle pagination locally
   - Properly sort results by relevance
   - Remove duplicates more effectively

2. Updated provider-specific search functions to use the new centralized error handling.

## Frontend Changes

### Paper Search Component (PaperSearch.vue)

1. Modified to use the advanced search endpoint for all searches.
2. Added caching for search results:
   - Stores complete result set in memory
   - Handles pagination locally without new API calls
   - Only makes a new API call when changing search parameters
  
3. Updated pagination methods to use the cached results.
4. Modified filter clearing to reset cached results and restart search with clean parameters.

## How to Test

1. Search for papers using any keywords.
2. Change databases (providers) and verify no errors occur.
3. Check that results are relevant to your search query.
4. Test pagination by navigating between pages and verify that:
   - It's faster than before (no loading spinner between pages)
   - The results are consistent (same papers shown in the same order)
   - No unexpected errors appear in the console

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive relevance scoring by including natural language understanding.
2. Implement partial word matching for better search results.
3. Add highlighting of matched terms in the search results.
4. Consider implementing server-side caching to reduce API calls for common searches.
