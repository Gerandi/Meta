REST API
Overview
The REST API gives anyone free, programmatic access to the Unpaywall database.

If you're using the API, we recommend you subscribe to the mailing list in order to stay up-to-date when there are changes or new features.

Schema
The API response uses the same shared schema as the database snapshot and Data Feed.

Authentication
Requests must include your email as a parameter at the end of the URL, like this: api.unpaywall.org/my/request?email=YOUR_EMAIL.

Rate limits
Please limit use to 100,000 calls per day. If you need faster access, you'll be better served by downloading the entire database snapshot for local access.

Versions
The current version of the API is Version 2, and this is the only version supported. Version updates are announced on the mailing list.

Alternatives
Depending on your use case, there are often easier ways to access the data than using the API. You can learn more about these in our brief Get Stated pages:

Endpoints
GET /v2/:doi
Description	Gets OA status and bibliographic info for an given DOI-assigned resource.
Accepts	A valid DOI.
Returns	DOI Object
Example	https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1038/nature12373?email=YOUR_EMAIL
GET /v2/search?query=:your_query[&is_oa=boolean][&page=integer]
Usage notes and additional examples are available in the Unpaywall FAQ.

This endpoint can be accessed through our Article Search tool.

Description	Provides the full GET /v2/:doi responses for articles whose titles match your query. 50 results are returned per request and the page argument requests pages after the first.
Accepts	
query: The text to search for. Search terms are separated by whitespace and are AND-ed together by default. The title must contain all search terms to be matched. This behavior can be modified by:
"quoted text" : words inside quotation marks must appear as a phrase to match
OR : replaces the default AND between words, making a match on either word
- : negation, only titles not containing this term will match
is_oa: (Optional) A boolean value indicating whether the returned records should be Open Access or not.
true: filter the results to OA articles
false: filter the results to non-OA articles
null/unspecified: return the most relevant results regardless of OA status
page: (Optional) An integer indicating which page of results should be returned.
1/unspecified: return results 1 to 50
2: return results 51 to 100
etc.
Returns	An array of results sorted by the strength of the query match. Each result consists of:
response: the full DOI Object for this match
score: the numeric score used to rank the results
snippet: An HTML-formatted string showing how the title matched the query. For example:
"Single-<b>cell</b> photoacoustic <b>thermometry</b>"
Example	https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/search?query=cell%20thermometry&is_oa=true&email=YOUR_EMAIL

Data Format
Overview
The database snapshot, Simple Query Tool, REST API, and Data Feed products all return JSON-formatted data. For simplicity, that data is organized under the same schema in all cases; that schema is informally described on this page.

Regardless of the source, each record returned consists of one DOI Object, containing resource metadata. Each DOI Object in turn contains a list of zero or more OA Location Objects.

New fields may be added at any time. This won't be a problem for existing code in most cases since they will simply go unused, but you shouldn't rely on the number of fields being fixed.

Fields marked (beta) may have their behavior changed without warning. Changes to other fields will be announced on the Unpaywall mailing list.

DOI object
The DOI object is more or less a row in our main database...it's everything we know about a given DOI-assigned resource, including metadata about the resource itself, and information about its OA status. It includes a list of zero or more OA Location Objects, as well as a best_oa_location property that's probably the OA Location you'll want to use.

best_oa_location
Object|null	The best OA Location Object we could find for this DOI.	
The "best" location is determined using an algorithm that prioritizes publisher-hosted content first (eg Hybrid or Gold), then prioritizes versions closer to the version of record (PublishedVersion over AcceptedVersion), then more authoritative repositories (PubMed Central over CiteSeerX).

Returns null if we couldn't find any OA Locations.

data_standard
Integer	Indicates the data collection approaches used for this resource.	
Possible values

1 First-generation hybrid detection. Uses only data from the Crossref API to determine hybrid status. Does a good job for Elsevier articles and a few other publishers, but most publishers are not checked for hybrid.
2 Second-generation hybrid detection. Uses additional sources, checks all publishers for hybrid. Gets about 10x as much hybrid. data_standard==2 is the version used in the paper we wrote about the dataset.
doi
String	The DOI of this resource.	This is always lowercase.
doi_url
String	The DOI in hyperlink form.	This field simply contains "https://doi.org/" prepended to the doi field. It expresses the DOI in its correct format according to the Crossref DOI display guidelines.
genre
String|null	The type of resource.	Currently the genre is identical to the Crossref-reported type of a given resource. The "journal-article" type is most common, but there are many others.
is_paratext
Boolean	Is the item an ancillary part of a journal, like a table of contents?	See here for more information on how we determine whether an article is paratext.
is_oa
Boolean	Is there an OA copy of this resource.	Convenience attribute; returns true when best_oa_location is not null.
journal_is_in_doaj
Boolean	Is this resource published in a DOAJ-indexed journal.	Useful for defining whether a resource is Gold OA (depending on your definition, see also journal_is_oa).
journal_is_oa
Boolean	Is this resource published in a completely OA journal.	Useful for defining whether a resource is Gold OA. Includes any fully-OA journal, regardless of inclusion in DOAJ. This includes journals by all-OA publishers and journals that would otherwise be all Hybrid or Bronze OA. See here for more information on OA journals.
journal_issns
String|null	Any ISSNs assigned to the journal publishing this resource.	Separate ISSNs are sometimes assigned to print and electronic versions of the same journal. If there are multiple ISSNs, they are separated by commas. Example: 1232-1203,1532-6203
journal_issn_l
String|null	A single ISSN for the journal publishing this resource.	An ISSN-L can be used as a primary key for a journal when more than one ISSN is assigned to it. Resources' journal_issns are mapped to ISSN-Ls using the issn.org table, with some manual corrections.
journal_name
String|null	The name of the journal publishing this resource.	The same journal may have multiple name strings (eg, "J. Foo", "Journal of Foo", "JOURNAL OF FOO", etc). These have not been fully normalized within our database, so use with care.
oa_locations
List	List of all the OA Location objects associated with this resource.	This list is unnecessary for the vast majority of use-cases, since you probably just want the best_oa_location. It's included primarily for research purposes.
oa_locations_embargoed (beta)
List	List of OA Location objects associated with this resource that are not yet available.	This list includes locations that we expect to be available in the future based on information like license metadata and journals' delayed OA policies. They do not affect the resource's oa_status and cannot be the best_oa_location or first_oa_location.
first_oa_location
Object|null	The OA Location Object with the earliest oa_date.	
Returns null if we couldn't find any OA Locations.

oa_status
String	The OA status, or color, of this resource.	Classifies OA resources by location and license terms as one of: gold, hybrid, bronze, green or closed. See here for more information on how we assign an oa_status.
has_repository_copy
Boolean	Whether there is a copy of this resource in a repository.	True if this resource has at least one OA Location with host_type = "repository". False otherwise.
published_date
String|null	The date this resource was published.	As reported by the publishers, who unfortunately have inconsistent definitions of what counts as officially "published." Returned as an ISO8601-formatted timestamp, generally with only year-month-day.
publisher
String|null	The name of this resource's publisher.	Keep in mind that publisher name strings change over time, particularly as publishers are acquired or split up.
title
String|null	The title of this resource.	It's the title. Pretty straightforward.
updated
String	Time when the data for this resource was last updated.	Returned as an ISO8601-formatted timestamp. Example: 2017-08-17T23:43:27.753663
year
Integer|null	The year this resource was published.	Just the year part of the published_date
z_authors
List of Crossref Contributor objects, or null	The authors of this resource.	These are formatted as a list of Crossref Contributor objects, which are described in the Crossref API docs here.
Contributor objects may also contain sequence elements, which at the time of writing are not included in the Crossref API docs.
OA Location object
The OA Location object describes particular place where we found a given OA article. The same article is often available from multiple locations, and there may be differences in format, version, and license depending on the location; the OA Location object describes these key attributes. An OA Location Object is always a Child of a DOI Object.

evidence
String	How we found this OA location.	
Used for debugging. Donâ€™t depend on the exact contents of this for anything, because values are subject to change without warning. Example values:

oa journal (via journal title in doaj) We found the name of the journal that publishes this article in the DOAJ database.
oa repository (via pmcid lookup) We found this article in an index of PubMed Central articles.
host_type
String	The type of host that serves this OA location.	
There are two possible values:

publisher means this location is served by the articleâ€™s publisher (in practice, this usually means it is hosted on the same domain the DOI resolves to).
repository means this location is served by an Open Access repository. Preprint servers are considered repositories even if the DOI resolves there.
is_best
Boolean	Is this location the best_oa_location for its resource.	See the DOI object's best_oa_location description for more on how we select which location is "best."
license
String|null	The license under which this copy is published.	
We return several types of licenses:

Creative Commons licenses are uniformly abbreviated and lowercased. Example: cc-by-nc
Publisher-specific licenses are normalized using this format: acs-specific: authorchoice/editors choice usage agreement
When we have evidence that an OA license of some kind was used, but itâ€™s not reported directly on the webpage at this location, this field returns implied-oa
If we are unable to determine a license, or it's not an OA license, this field is null.
oa_date
String|null	When this document first became available at this location.	
oa_date is calculated differently for different host types and is not available for all oa_locations. See https://support.unpaywall.org/a/solutions/articles/44002063719 for details.

pmh_id
String|null	OAI-PMH endpoint where we found this location.	This is primarily for internal debugging. It's null for locations that weren't found using OAI-PMH.
updated
String	Time when the data for this location was last updated.	Returned as an ISO8601-formatted timestamp. Example: 2017-08-17T23:43:27.753663
url
String	The url_for_pdf if there is one; otherwise landing page URL.	
When we can't find a url_for_pdf (or there isn't one), this field uses the url_for_landing_page, which is a useful fallback for some use cases.

url_for_landing_page
String	The URL for a landing page describing this OA copy.	
When the host_type is "publisher" the landing page usually includes HTML fulltext.

url_for_pdf
String|null	The URL with a PDF version of this OA copy.	
Pretty much what it says.

version
String	The content version accessible at this location.	
We use the DRIVER Guidelines v2.0 VERSION standard to define versions of a given article; see those docs for complete definitions of terms. Here's the basic idea, though, for the three version types we support:

submittedVersion is not yet peer-reviewed.
acceptedVersion is peer-reviewed, but lacks publisher-specific formatting.
publishedVersion is the version of record.
