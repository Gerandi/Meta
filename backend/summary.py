We've successfully implemented a standardized API client for the Meta Research Review project.
The following components have been created or modified:

1. Created a new standardized API client module:
   - api_client.py: Provides uniform interfaces to various academic paper APIs

2. Updated existing provider implementations to use the standardized client:
   - additional_providers.py: Now uses the standardized API client
   - paper_provider.py: Now uses the standardized API client 
   - unpaywall.py: Now uses the standardized API client

3. Configured API keys properly:
   - Added API keys to the .env file
   - Updated config.py to read these keys from environment variables
   - Updated api_client.py to use these settings

4. Created testing tools:
   - test_api_client.py: Tests each API client function to verify they work properly
   - run_test.bat: A batch file to easily run the tests

    print_header("API Client Features")
    print("""
The standardized API client provides:
- Consistent error handling across all providers
- Standardized response format for all providers
- Proper handling of timeouts and connection issues
- Uniform field names and data structures

Supported providers:
- Crossref API
- Semantic Scholar API
- Scopus API
- Exa.ai API
- Unpaywall API

    print_header("Next Steps")
    print("""
1. Run the test script (run_test.bat) to verify all API clients are working correctly
2. Implement the paper processing component in the frontend
3. Connect the frontend to the backend API endpoints
4. Add more detailed error handling and user feedback in the UI
